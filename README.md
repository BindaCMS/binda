## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'binda', '~> 0.0.5'
```

Then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

To install Binda run the installer from terminal. 
``` bash
$ rails g binda:install
```

Now you are good to go. Run `rails s` and check the administration panel at `http://localhost:3000/admin_panel`.

To get into details read [Binda Guidelines](https://github.com/lacolonia/binda/wiki).

**Warning: run the installer once.** Running the installer for each application environment will cause issues with users' passwords. Also remember that if you need to re-install Binda you need to drop all Binda database tables first. More details [here](https://github.com/lacolonia/binda/wiki/Installation)
