module Binda
	# `Binda::Selection` class provides support for **selection**, **radio** and **checkbox** fields.
	# 
	# More specifically `Binda::Selection` is used for **selection** fields, whereas **radio** and 
	#   **checkbox** fields depend on `Binda::Radio` and `Binda::Checkbox` which are subclasses of `Binda::Selection`.
	#   
	# The architecture behind this class is pretty complex and deserves some attention. 
	#   Here the rules that defines the class behaviour:
	#   
	# 1. Every selection can have multiple **choices** (see `Binda::Choice`) or none.
	# 
	# 2. Every **selection** depends on a **field setting** (see `Binda::FieldSetting` 
	#   [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/binda/Binda/FieldSetting)) which specify its behaviour.
	# 
	# 3. Every time you create a **field setting** a fallback ensure a **selection** exists for every 
	#   **component** or **board** to which this **field setting** belongs. This ensure calling `get_selection_choices`
	#   method doesn't throw a error.
	#   ```ruby
	#   # Create a field setting for a component
	#   component = Binda::Component.first
	#   field_setting = component.structure.field_groups.first.field_settings.create(
	#       name: 'my selection',
	#       field_type: 'selection'
	#   )
	#   # Reload component so the Active Record object is updated
	#   component.reload
	#   # We know for sure a selection exists
	#   component.selections.any?
	#   # => true
	#   # We might not find any choice though
	#   component.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # => []
	#   ```
	#   
	# 4. When a **field setting** is created there is no **choice** available yet. Only if a **setting** requires 
	#   at least a **choice**, a new **choice** is created. In that case the **choice** is also automatically set as 
	#   the **default choice** for the **field setting** and applied to all **selections** that didn't have any **choice**. 
	#   Again, this behaviour exists just for **field settings** that requires at least a **choice** and has just 
	#   been created. Changing the **field setting** **default choice** persisted on the database with another one 
	#   won't change the **selected choice** of any **selections** created before: they will keep the previous 
	#   **default choice**. For more info look at `Binda::Choice` 
	#   [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/binda/Binda/Choice)
	#   ```ruby
	#   # Create a field setting for a component (note: allow_null is set to false)
	#   component = Binda::Component.first
	#   field_setting = component.structure.field_groups.first.field_settings.create(
	#       name: 'my selection',
	#       field_type: 'selection', 
	#       allow_null: false # IMPORTANT: this means field setting requires at least a choice
	#   )
	#   # If field setting doesn't allow null, it means we always expect a choice to be selected
	#   component.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # A default choice is returned
	#   # => [{ label: 'Temporary choice', value: 'temporary-choice' }]
	#   component.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # => [{ label: 'Temporary choice', value: 'temporary-choice' }]
	#   # When we remove the initial choice we fallback to default
	#   field_setting.choices.first.delete
	#   # => error!
	#   field_setting.choices.create(
	#       label: 'second', 
	#       value: 'second'
	#   )
	#   field_setting.choices.first.destroy
	#   component.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # => [{ label: 'second', value: 'second' }]
	#   ```
	# 
	# 5. Every time a **field setting** is updated a fallback ensures all **selections** relying on it are updated as well.
	#   ```ruby
	#   # Create a field setting for a component
	#   component = Binda::Component.first
	#   field_setting = component.structure.field_groups.first.field_settings.create(
	#       name: 'my selection',
	#       field_type: 'selection', 
	#       allow_null: false
	#   )
	#   field_setting.choices.create([
	#       {
	#           label: 'first', 
	#           value: 'first'
	#       },
	#       {
	#           label: 'second', 
	#           value: 'second'
	#       },
	#   ])
	#   # field_setting automatically assigns **first choice** as default and replace the **temporary default choice**.
	#   # Now reload component to update it with the instances just created
	#   component.reload
	#   component.selections.first.choices << field_setting.choices.first
	#   component.selections.first.choices << field_setting.choices.last
	#   component.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # => [{ label: 'first', value: 'first' }, { label: 'second', value: 'second' }]
	#   # Remove the initial choice
	#   field_setting.choices.first.delete
	#   # Get selection choices again. Now you should get a different result
	#   component.reload.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # => [{ label: 'second', value: 'second' }]
	#   ```
	# 
	# 6. (This is the trickiest) 
	#   Assuming that 
	#   1) **field setting** requires at least a **choice**, 
	#   2) there is only one **choice** available, 
	#   3) some **selections** are associated to that **choice**. 
	#   If the user replace that **choice** with another one, all **selections** fields will be associated to 
	#   the new one.
	#   ```ruby
	#   # Create a field setting for a component
	#   component = Binda::Component.first
	#   field_setting = component.structure.field_groups.first.field_settings.create(
	#       name: 'my selection',
	#       field_type: 'selection', 
	#       allow_null: false
	#   )
	#   # Trying to delete the default temporary choice, which is the only one, won't work
	#   field_setting.choices.first.destroy
	#   # => false
	#   # You need to create another choice first
	#   field_setting.choices.create(
	#       label: 'Second', 
	#       value: 'second'
	#   )
	#   field_setting.choices.first.destroy
	#   component.reload.get_selection_choices(field_setting.slug)
	#   # => [{ label: 'second', value: 'second' }]
	#   # BE AWARE THAT:
	#   field_setting.choices.delete_all
	#   # => deletes everything skipping callbacks and will cause inconsistency throughout the database
	#   ```
