  # Relation 
  # 
  # This model is used to connect components and boards to each others.
  # 
  # `Relation` gathers all connection a `Component` record has with other records (being 
  #   another `Component` or `Board`). It's possible to have multiple relations for the 
  #   same component and each one can gather connections to several other components.
  #   Any relation has one owner and several dependents. A relation is a one-direction operation
  #   meaning that an owner can choose its dependents, not the other way around.
  #   
  # Reference: https://www.railstutorial.org/book/following_users
  # 
  # @example: owner = Binda::Component.first
  #   dependent = Binda::Component.last
  #   relation_setting = Binda::FieldSetting.create(field_type: relation, field_group_id: owner.structure.field_groups.first)
  #   relation = owner.relations.where(field_setting_id: relation_setting.id).first
  #   relation.dependent_components << dependent
