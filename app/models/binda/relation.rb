  # Related Field 
  # 
  # This model is used to connect components and boards to each others.
  # 
  # The gotcha here is that a `RelatedField` gathers all associations a `Component`
  #   record has with other records. At the moment we are just using the parent relation for which 
  #   a component can be connected to components via a parent relation (it has many parent related components).
  #   Another version, not applied to the current administration panel is the children relation, which connect 
  #   components in a has-many-children-related components. This was created to avoid confusion when connecting components
  #   in multiple directions, for example: component A is connected to its parent component B, while component B 
  #   is connected to its parent component C; doing `component.related_fields.owner_components` we should get 
  #   only component C, while `component.related_fields` should return both A and C.
