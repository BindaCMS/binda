module Binda
	# This class provides support for storing text. It can be called directly to get texts, 
	#   or referenced to call other classes depending on it that deal differently with text.
	#   
	# Binda uses this class to store complex texts usually with rich HTML features. On the admin panel infact 
	#   this field is represented by a WYSIWYG. But this is just a admin panel convention: the class can infact store 
	#   a simple string of text as well.
